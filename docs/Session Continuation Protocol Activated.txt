# Session Continuation Protocol Activated

This document outlines the official procedure for transferring conversation context from one Codex session to another.

## Four-Step Transfer

1. **Preparation** – Gather prior chat logs, code snippets, and outstanding tasks. Clarify the objective for the next session.
2. **Cataloging** – List relevant files, commands run, test results, and decisions that must persist.
3. **Identify Critical Segments** – Highlight requirements, blockers, and open questions that the next session must address.
4. **Final Prompt** – Compose a concise handoff message using the template below.

## Standard Codex Prompt Template

```
🧠 Context
- <short recap of previous session>

🎯 Goal
- <primary task or question>

🔧 Work
- <steps or commands already executed>

⚠️ Risks
- <edge cases or potential issues>

📋 Next
- <immediate next action or open questions>
```

Use Markdown with one bullet per section. Provide enough detail for the new session to continue seamlessly.
