# QA Report

`qa-report.php` aggregates coverage, schema validation, REST permission scan and
SQL prepare results.

## Running

```bash
php scripts/qa-report.php
```

The script writes `artifacts/qa/qa-report.json` and `artifacts/qa/qa-report.html`
and never exits with a nonâ€‘zero status.

## JSON schema

Arrays and object keys are sorted for determinism. The HTML variant renders the
same information in a basic RTL layout.
