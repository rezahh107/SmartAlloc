- **Memory Limit**: Minimum 256MB PHP memory limit
- **Upload Directory**: Writable uploads directory

### Plugin Dependencies

- **Gravity Forms Pro**: Required for form processing
- **Action Scheduler**: Recommended for async processing
- **PhpSpreadsheet**: Required for Excel export functionality

### Server Requirements

- **File Permissions**: Write access to uploads directory
- **Database Permissions**: CREATE, ALTER, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- **PHP Extensions**: JSON, PDO, PDO_MySQL, ZIP
- **Memory**: Sufficient memory for Excel processing

## Configuration Assumptions

### Gravity Forms Setup

- Form ID 150 is the default target form
- Specific field IDs are expected (see field mapping)
- Form validation is enabled
- Entry logging is enabled

### Export Configuration

- Configuration file exists at `/wp-content/uploads/SmartAlloc_Exporter_Config_v1.json`
- Fallback to plugin directory if uploads file not found
- Excel file format is XLSX
- File naming follows specified pattern

### Database Assumptions

- WordPress database prefix is used
- Tables are created with proper charset and collation
- Indexes are created for performance
- Foreign key constraints are not used (WordPress compatibility)

## Data Assumptions

### Student Data

- National ID is 10 digits
- Mobile numbers are Iranian format (09xxxxxxxxx)
- Gender values are 'F' or 'M'
- Center IDs are numeric
- School codes are numeric

### Mentor Data

- Mentor capacity is positive integer
- Mentor gender matches student gender
- Mentor center matches student center
- Mentor is active (active = 1)

### Allocation Logic

- Capacity-based allocation
- Gender matching required
- Center matching required
- Load balancing by occupancy ratio
- Fallback to mentor ID if all else equal

## Performance Assumptions

### Caching

- Object cache is available (Redis/Memcached)
- Transients are supported
- Cache invalidation is manual
- Cache TTL is reasonable

### Processing

- Single-threaded processing
- Event deduplication prevents duplicates
- Async processing for heavy operations
- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures

## Security Assumptions

### Access Control

- WordPress capability system is used
- `manage_smartalloc` capability is defined
- Nonces are used for forms
- Input sanitization is applied

### Data Protection

- Sensitive data is masked in logs
- SQL injection is prevented
- XSS is prevented
- CSRF is prevented

## Integration Assumptions

### External Services

- Gravity Forms API is available
- Action Scheduler hooks are available
- WordPress hooks and filters are available
- REST API is enabled

### File System

- Upload directory is writable
- Temporary files can be created
- File permissions are correct
- Disk space is sufficient

## Error Handling Assumptions

### Graceful Degradation

- Plugin continues working if optional dependencies missing
- Fallback mechanisms are in place
- Error logging is comprehensive
- User-friendly error messages

### Recovery

- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Manual intervention possible for persistent issues
- Rollback procedures available

## Monitoring Assumptions

### Health Checks

- Database connectivity is testable
- Cache connectivity is testable
- External services are reachable
- Metrics collection is possible

### Logging

- WordPress error logging is available
- Log rotation is handled by system
- Log levels are configurable
- Sensitive data is masked

## Deployment Assumptions

### Environment

- Staging environment available
- Database backups are regular
- File backups are regular
- Rollback procedures exist

### Configuration

- Environment-specific configuration
- Secrets are properly managed
- Configuration validation
- Default values are safe

## Future Assumptions

### Scalability

- Horizontal scaling possible
- Database sharding possible
- Load balancing possible
- Microservices architecture possible

### Technology Evolution

- PHP 8.2+ features available
- WordPress 6.4+ features available
- Modern frontend frameworks possible
- API-first architecture possible

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk

- **Missing Dependencies**: Graceful degradation and clear error messages
- **Configuration Errors**: Validation and default values
- **Database Issues**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Medium Risk

- **Performance Issues**: Caching and async processing
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Input validation and access control
- **Integration Failures**: Circuit breakers and fallbacks

### Low Risk

- **Monitoring Gaps**: Health checks and metrics
- **Documentation Issues**: Comprehensive documentation
- **Testing Gaps**: Automated testing and CI/CD
