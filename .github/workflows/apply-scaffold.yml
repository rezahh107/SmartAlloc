            This PR applies the clean SmartAlloc scaffold:
            - Strict unit isolation (UTC + WordPress contamination sentinel)
            - Minimal Docker-based integration runner (graceful skip locally)
            - GitHub Actions: unit matrix (no Xdebug), DinD integration, composer audit
            - PSR-12 code style commands
            **AC**
            - `composer test:unit` green without touching WP/DB
            - Runner owns `compose up --wait / down -v`, integration skips if Docker absent
            - CI runs 3 jobs (unit, integration, security)
